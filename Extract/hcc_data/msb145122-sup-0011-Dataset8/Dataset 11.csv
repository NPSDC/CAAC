In studies investigating cytosine deamination by DNA methyltransferase, it was noted that the presence of Sinefungin increased the rate of deamination 103 fold in the presence of its analog SAM, and 104 in the absence of SAM. This may suggest that Sinefungin could be useful as a test compound in antiviral, anticancer, antiparasitic and antifungal applications. Additional studies indicate that Sinefungin was able to inhibit RNA synthesis in a vaccinia virion preparation. SAM biosynthesis, catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), is the first step in methionine catabolism. SAM is the link to three key metabolic pathways Ð polyamine synthesis, transmethylation and transsulfuration. In polyamine synthesis, SAM is decarboxylated and the remaining propylamino moiety attached to its sulfonium ion is donated to putrescine and spermidine. Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a by-product in this pathway. In transmethylation, SAM donates its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor molecules in reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases (MT). SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) during transmethylation and SAH is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation reactions. SAH is hydrolyzed to form homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine through a reversible reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase, whose thermodynamics favors biosynthesis rather than hydrolysis. In vivo, this reaction proceeds as hydrolysis because the products Hcy and adenosine are promptly removed. Hcy can be remethylated to form methionine via methionine synthase (MS), which requires folate and vitamin B12 and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, which requires betaine. Remethylation of homocysteine via MS requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is derived from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) in a reaction catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 5-MTHF is then converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) as it donates its methyl group and THF is converted to 5,10-MTHF, which is important for thymidylate and purine synthesis. Hcy can also become converted to cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor for glutathione (GSH), via the trans-sulfuration pathway via a two-step enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionine _-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase, both requiring vitamin B6.(PMID: 18336669)",PMID:15056663;PMID:11716715;PMID:8774911;PMID:659406,L-cystathionine,83,Cysteine and methionine metabolism,ENSG00000116761,Activity correlates with cancer progression,Two SNPs in the CTH gene were significantly associated with bladder cancer risk (PMID:17311259).
