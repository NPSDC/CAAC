Problem
How to compare cancer.liver and normal.liver?
Former contains counts at all levels of the proteins while latter contains 2 types of cells and their concentration
Further former contains cancer type and could it be a case that protein expresssed at higher concentrations in other tissue might lead to cancer in the tissue of interest
